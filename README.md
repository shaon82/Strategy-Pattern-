The design pattern used in the provided Java implementation is the Strategy Pattern. This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family. This approach lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. Here's a line-by-line description of how this pattern is implemented in the provided code:

public interface FlyBehavior: Defines a FlyBehavior interface, which declares a fly method. This interface will be implemented by different flying behavior

public class FlyWithWings implements FlyBehavior: Implements the FlyBehavior interface, providing an actual implementation for the fly method.
@Override: Indicates that the fly method is being overridden from the FlyBehavior interface.
fly() method: Outputs a message indicating that the duck is flying with wings.

public class FlyNoWay implements FlyBehavior: Another implementation of the FlyBehavior interface, representing ducks that cannot fly.
fly() method: Outputs a message indicating that the duck cannot fly.

public interface QuackBehavior: Defines a QuackBehavior interface, which declares a quack method. This interface will be implemented by different quacking be.

public class Quack implements QuackBehavior: Implements the QuackBehavior interface, providing an actual implementation for the quack method.
quack() method: Outputs a standard "Quack!" sound.

public class Squeak implements QuackBehavior: Another implementation of the QuackBehavior interface, representing ducks that squeak.
quack() method: Outputs a squeak sound.

public class MuteQuack implements QuackBehavior: Another implementation of the QuackBehavior interface, representing ducks that do not make any sound.
quack() method: Outputs silence.

public abstract class Duck: Defines an abstract Duck class that will be extended by specific types of ducks.
FlyBehavior flyBehavior; QuackBehavior quackBehavior;: References to FlyBehavior and QuackBehavior interfaces, allowing the duck's behavior to be set at runtime.
public abstract void display();: An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to display the specific type of duck.
performFly() method: Calls the fly method of the FlyBehavior instance.
performQuack() method: Calls the quack method of the QuackBehavior instance.
swim() method: Outputs a message indicating that all ducks can float.
setFlyBehavior(FlyBehavior fb) method: Allows setting the FlyBehavior at runtime.
setQuackBehavior(QuackBehavior qb) method: Allows setting the QuackBehavior at runtime.

public class MallardDuck extends Duck: Implements a specific type of Duck.
MallardDuck() constructor: Sets the flyBehavior to FlyWithWings and quackBehavior to Quack.
display() method: Outputs a message indicating that this is a Mallard duck.

public class RedheadDuck extends Duck: Implements another specific type of Duck.
RedheadDuck() constructor: Sets the flyBehavior to FlyWithWings and quackBehavior to Quack.
display() method: Outputs a message indicating that this is a Redhead duck.

public class RubberDuck extends Duck: Implements another specific type of Duck.
RubberDuck() constructor: Sets the flyBehavior to FlyNoWay and quackBehavior to Squeak.
display() method: Outputs a message indicating that this is a Rubber duck.

public class DecoyDuck extends Duck: Implements another specific type of Duck.
DecoyDuck() constructor: Sets the flyBehavior to FlyNoWay and quackBehavior to MuteQuack.
display() method: Outputs a message indicating that this is a Decoy duck.

public class MiniDuckSimulator: A test class to demonstrate the behavior of different ducks.
main(String[] args) method: The entry point of the program.
Duck mallard = new MallardDuck();: Creates a new MallardDuck instance.
mallard.performQuack(); mallard.performFly();: Calls the performQuack and performFly methods to demonstrate the Mallard duck's behaviors.
Duck model = new DecoyDuck();: Creates a new DecoyDuck instance.
model.performFly();: Demonstrates that the Decoy duck cannot fly.
model.setFlyBehavior(new FlyWithWings()); model.performFly();: Dynamically changes the FlyBehavior of the Decoy duck to FlyWithWings and demonstrates that it can now fly.
This design pattern allows for flexible and reusable code. The behaviors (flying and quacking) are encapsulated in their own classes, and the duck objects can change behaviors dynamically at runtime, promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
